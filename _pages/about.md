Research Interest
======
My main research interest is focusing on MLSys:
* Performance & Efficiency: Developing techniques for inference acceleration and enhancing overall model efficiency.
* System Architecture: Exploring optimization strategies for distributed systems and heterogeneous systems.
* Application Domains: Applying MLSys principles to music generation models and multi-modal models.
