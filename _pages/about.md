I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, pursuing a double major in Computer Sciences and Statistics.

My academic interests lie at the intersection of MLSys, distributed systems, and computational efficiency. I am passionate about optimizing complex models to enable faster inference and more efficient resource utilization. My current research projects explore applying these ideas to music generation and multi-modal models.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an avid fan of soccer, spending most of my free time playing and watching matches. I also enjoy a variety of indoor hobbies like reading, watching movies, and anime.

I am always looking for opportunities to apply my skills and collaborate on challenging projects. Feel free to get in touch!

Research Interest
======
My main research interest is focusing on MLSys:
* Performance & Efficiency: Developing techniques for inference acceleration and enhancing overall model efficiency.
* System Architecture: Exploring optimization strategies for distributed systems and heterogeneous systems.
* Application Domains: Applying MLSys principles to music generation models and multi-modal models.
